     * We use composite aggregation for feature aggregation.  But composite aggregation
     * does not support ordering results based on doc count, which is required by
     * preview and historical related components.  We need to use terms aggregation.
     * Terms aggregation does not support collecting terms from multiple fields in
     * the same document.  Scripts come to the rescue: With a script to retrieve terms
     * from multiple fields, we can still use terms aggregation to partition data.
     * The script disables the global ordinals optimization and will be slower than
     * collecting terms from a single field.  Still, it gives us the flexibility to
     * implement this option at search time. For a simple example, consider the
     * following query about the number fieldâ€™s sum aggregation on buckets partitioned
     * by category_field_1 and category_field_2 from index test.
     *
     * Query:
     * GET /test/_search
